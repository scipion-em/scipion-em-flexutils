V3.0.2
   - Zernike3Deep method: Semi-classical neural network for estimation of conformational states based on the Zernike3D basis
   - HetSIREN method: Neural network heterogeneous reconstruction for real space
   - HomoSIREN method: Neural network homogeneous reconstruction for real space
   - DeepPose method: Neural network for angular alignment refinement
   - DeepNMA method: Semi-classical neural network for estimation of conformational states based on the NMA basis
   - FlexConsensus method: Consensus neural network for conformational landscapes
   - DeepElastic method: Dimensionality reduction based on elastic cluster analysis
   - Dimensionality reduction and landscape visualization splitted into two different protocols
   - Strain and rotation analysis for deformation fields (currently for Zernike3D and NMA)
   - Clustering at the structural model space (Zernike3D)
   - Optimal number of clusters analysis
Developers:
   - New data model for Flexibility Hub including several Scipion dynamic objects
   - Flexibility Hub protocols.conf added
   - Some protocols might rely on new xmipp-metadata Pypi package to read Xmipp metadata without the need to rely on Scipion/Xmipp
   - Tensorflow related protocols will rely on the new tensorflow-toolkit (Flexutils) Pypi package to properly setup the Tensorflow GPU environment
